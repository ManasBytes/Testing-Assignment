# Zomato Login Automation (CR04)

This project is a Selenium-based automation assignment solution created with the intention to automate some Critially Regression Test Cases  using supported methods.

Due to security restrictions imposed by Google Identity Services and OTP-based authentication, **login completion is performed manually**, while Selenium is used to trigger the flow and verify the post-login state.
